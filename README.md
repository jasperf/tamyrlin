## 🎮 About This Course

This interactive course teaches you **game development with Python** using the [Arcade library](https://api.arcade.academy/). Through a combination of in-browser worksheets and hands-on coding projects, you'll build a complete 2-level platformer game from scratch.

### 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have a fully functional platformer game featuring:

- **Player character** with smooth movement and jumping
- **Platforms** to stand on and jump between
- **Gravity physics** for realistic movement
- **Camera scrolling** to explore large levels
- **Coins** to collect with score tracking
- **Enemies** with AI patrol behavior
- **Two complete levels** loaded from JSON files
- **Polish** - graphics, sound effects, menus, and more!

### 🐍 Prerequisites

Before starting, you should be comfortable with:

- Python basics (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Functions and parameters
- Lists and dictionaries
- Basic object-oriented programming (classes)

If you're new to Python, complete a beginner Python course first.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Python

Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or newer** installed on your Mac.

Check your Python version:
```bash
python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Install Arcade

Open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
pip3 install arcade
```

Verify the installation worked:
```bash
python3 -c "import arcade; print('Arcade is ready!')"
```

You should see: `Arcade is ready!`

### 3. Start the Course

Open the course online and begin with the first worksheet:
- **[Course Home](https://jasperf.github.io/tamyrlin/index.html)** - All worksheets in one place
- **[Arcade Introduction](https://jasperf.github.io/tamyrlin/arcade-intro.html)** - Learn about Arcade, install it, and create your first window

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'arcade'` | Run `pip3 install arcade` |
| Window opens but closes immediately | You forgot `arcade.run()` at the end of your file |
| Player doesn't move | Check your `on_key_press` method registration |
| Player falls through platforms | Ensure you're using `arcade.check_for_collision_with_list()` |
| Images not showing | Check file paths are correct, images are in the right folder |

### Still Stuck?

- Check the **code examples** in each worksheet carefully
- Look at the **troubleshooting section** at the bottom of each sheet
- Review the **previous sheets** - you might have missed a key concept
- Try **restarting your code** from the provided template

## 🎨 Assets

You'll need some basic game assets (sprites and sounds). Options:

### Option 1: Create Your Own (Recommended)
Draw simple pixel art sprites using:
- [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) - Free online pixel art editor
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) - Paid but excellent ($20)

### Option 2: Use Free Assets
Download free game assets from:
- [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/) - CC0 licensed (free for any use)
- [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/) - Various licenses
- [itch.io/free](https://itch.io/game-assets/free) - Free game assets

### Option 3: Use Emoji Placeholders
For quick testing, you can use emoji as temporary sprites:
```python
# In your code, use text instead of sprites
arcade.draw_text("🟥", x, y, arcade.csscolor.WHITE, 24)
```
